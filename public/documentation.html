    <h1>My Movie API</h1>
    <p>
        The server-side of this API was built to allow users to get information on different movies, movie genres, directors and actors/actresses. Users can also register, creating a user name and password, as well as allow them to create a list of their favorite movies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Errors are returned with HTTP response code and messages are sent detailing the error/s are included in the response body.
